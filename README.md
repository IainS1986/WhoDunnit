Xamarin Forms Cluedo Solver

I've used Xamarin since 2013 within my job but I've never used Xamarin Forms. This is basically because we used Xamarin long before Forms existed so we developed our own internal libraries and tools.

This is a bit of a test project for my own benefit to pick up and learn some Forms work, possibly using some other libraries too (keen to maybe use Prism for the MVVM bindings).

The app itself is going to be Cluedo Solver.


# Why Cluedo?

Every christmas in the Stanford household, many boardgames are played. However the one that you could say started it all is Cluedo and is still played every year as "tradition".

Recently I was keen to try out an App that "solves" Cluedo for you. The idea being, that you input the questions asked and the responses given, and the app will give you percentage probabilities over who, where and what the murder weapon *might* be.

The App could take in quite a few data points too and really could get somewhat complex in how it analyzes what people are asking. It could also suggest the most optimal question to ask in a given room to aid the app in narrowing down the correct answer more.

Really, its just an exercise to learn Xamarin Forms, but the aim is to have this working on iOS and Android devices, and maybe even Phone and Tablet layouts.
